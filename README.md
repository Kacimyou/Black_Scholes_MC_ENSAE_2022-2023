# Black_Scholes_MC_ENSAE_2022-2023

This code is a pricing library based on BSM model and Monte Carlo method. It can price vanilla option as well as various exotic options.

This code can price : Asian, Lookback, Barrier, Gap, Binary, Chooser and European with Stochastic parameters Options.


## Setup

We mainly coded on Code::Blocks v20.03 but we included a MAKEFILE.txt in the git so that you can run the code if you don't use an IDE that do it for you. 

In case the MAKEFILE does not work, here is a link to access the code directly on internet without any installation needed :  https://onlinegdb.com/FeDjOYmpm




    
## Structure

The header file is OptionPricing.h, the source code is OptionPricing.cpp and the main is main.cpp . You can test the code through the main, by testing the example that we already input.
